### Translations

There's a big need for help with the translations. They're machine generated, and not too good.

The main translation files are in the [src/assets/languages](https://github.com/BitolaCo/weather-app/tree/master/src/assets/languages) 
directory. Feel free to sumbit a PR to help if you speak any of the languages listed there natively. 
These translations are for the main portion of the app, not for the forecast itself.

If you'd like to add a language that's not there, by all means go ahead and do so!

Speak another language that's not on the list? Or forecast translations for you language not quite right? 
Locale related data is from the AngularJS project, and the translation of the forecast data itself is 
from [Forecast.io](//forecast.io). You can contribute to their translations via the [darkskyapp/forecast-io-translations repositor](https://github.com/darkskyapp/forecast-io-translations).
